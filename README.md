# Pacman Machine Learning Project

Using pacman to explore different aspects of machine learning:
1. Search Algorithms
2. Multiagent Search and Evaluation Functions
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Bayes Nets and Hidden Markov Models (Particle Filtering)
5. Machine Learning (Classification, Neural Networks)
